âœ¨ Iâ€™m an indie developer building apps at Shapr Lab (coming soon) and Iâ€™ve been doing iOS development since 2010.

I love creating delightful experiences through code and design. I previously started [SUPL](https://twitter.com/suplco), a mobile-only e-commerce app. I also happen to be an early contributor to a few successful apps like [Mojo](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mojo-insta-story-editor/id1434861974), [Quik](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gopro-quik-video-editor/id561350520) (acquired by GoPro) and [Zenly](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zenly-your-map-your-people/id838848566) (acquired by Snapchat).

Photography used to be a big part of my life. Some of them are visible on my [Photoblog](https://alikaragoz.net) and [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/alikaragoz) if you are curious.
